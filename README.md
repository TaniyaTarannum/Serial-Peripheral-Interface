# Serial-Peripheral-Interface 
## Abstract
This project presents the design and implementation of a customized SPI interface, developed from RTL to GDSII. The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a high-speed, synchronous communication protocol that supports full-duplex data transfer between a master and multiple slave devices. In this work, the SPI interface is employed to enable communication between a microcontroller and two Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs). Data is received serially from the microcontroller and subsequently distributed in parallel to the DACs. The design was implemented using 65nm CMOS technology with a 9-metal-layer process, encompassing all stages from behavioral modeling to physical layout.
